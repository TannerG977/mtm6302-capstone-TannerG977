- I am choosing the quiz website option. 

# Part 2

I made the design decisions for my site based on some design principals I've learned over the course of the program. For the color scheme I used an online color generator to generate a palette that I thought would suit my quiz site. I designed the logo with two question marks and an exclamation mark to fit the quiz theme. Everything else was designed with simplicity and the user in mind. 

# Part 3
To code the prototype for my capstone project, I recycled a lot of code I had already written in the previous coding classes all throughout IMD. I decided to use CSS to style the site as I feel I am more familiar with that than Bootstrap. However, I did use an external bootstrap and javascript library in order to make the hamburger menu for the mobile version of the site. I also found that the W3schools site comntained a lot of useful information while I was coding. Often if I needed help rembering how something worked I would use that website. The part I struggled with the most was making a responsive mobile design because I forgot that you should always code mobile first. I instead coded desktop first which lead to problems when I started trying to code the mobile version. 

# Part 4
I had to make adjustments to the site to make sure it was a one page web application. The most challenging part was trying to get the application to recognize and report when an answer was right and wrong. I emailed Mr. Ramirez about the issue and he was able to help me. There were a few more things that caused roadblocks such as when to use queryselector so I could have to different elements that use the same java function, but I was able to figure that out through google searching solutions.

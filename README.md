# Part 2

I made the design decisions for my site based on some design principals I've learned over the course of the program. For the color scheme I used an online color generator to generate a palette that I thought would suit my quiz site. I designed the logo with two question marks and an exclamation mark to fit the quiz theme. Everything else was designed with simplicity and the user in mind.
